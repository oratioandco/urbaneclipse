# Specification Quality Checklist: Telephoto Line-of-Sight Planner ("Plaster Void")

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-07-20
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Spec is tech-agnostic by design: the mandated stack (framework, UI library,
  3D engine, ephemeris library, state manager, styling) and any shader/post-
  processing code are intentionally excluded — they belong in the constitution
  (Technology & Stack Constraints) and the `/speckit-plan` output, not the spec.
- Scope is explicitly bounded to Berlin (Mitte + Lichtenberg) for v1; this is
  documented as a reasoned assumption rather than a blocking clarification
  because the data-procurement phase already implies Berlin-only data.
- Items marked complete passed self-review. Spec is ready for `/speckit-clarify`
  (if the user wants to challenge assumptions) or `/speckit-plan`.
